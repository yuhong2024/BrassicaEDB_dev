## Introduction

*Brassica* Expression Database (BrassicaEDB), a transcriptomic database of *Brassica* L. based on the Yu’s Triangle, we have collected six species of *Brassica* L. : three diploid basic species  *Brassica rapa* (AA, n = 10), *Brassica oleracea* (CC, n = 9) and *Brassica nigra* (BB, n = 8) , three tetraploid hybrid species *Brassica napus* (AACC, n = 19), *Brassica juncea* (AABB, n = 18), *Brassica carinata* (BBCC, n = 17), **2,992 transcriptome data** from **178 Bioprojects** in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database were analyzed, and the genomes of **39 different cultivars of six species of *Brassica* L.** were also collected. We used *Brassica carinata* 10167_V1, *Brassica juncea* Tumida_V2, *Brassica napus* ZS11, *Brassica nigra* NI100_V2, *Brassica oleracea* JZS_V2, *Brassica rapa* Chiifu_V4 were analyzed as reference genomes for each *Brassica* L.. The purpose of BrassicaEDB is to collect, organize, analyze, and display more transcriptome data of the six species of *Brassica* L., so that users can (1) query **detailed information** related to the genes of the six species; (2) To obtain the gene **expression levels** of six species under **different conditions, periods, tissues and treatments**; (3) Search for **transcription factors** and **regulatory networks** in six species; (4) Search the **gene co-expression network** of six species; (5) Search for **homologous genes** among six species; (6) To investigate the occurrence of **alternative splicing** in different species; (7) Use simple and convenient analytical tools.

## Our team

This database is produced by Lu Kun team, the innovation team of rapesnapus biology of Southwest University. Our team is led by Professor Lu Kun and consists of dozens of outstanding postdoctors, doctoral students, master students and undergraduates. Under the guidance of Professor Lu Kun, our team has published dozens of high-quality scientific and technological papers in international journals and obtained a variety of results. Many excellent talents have been cultivated.
